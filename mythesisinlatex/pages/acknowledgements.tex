I would like to thank my advisor Béatrice who guided me throughout the way with quick answers to any questions I had. I would also like to thank my friend Kai who gave me a lot of advises for building the data crawling tool. Also, I would like to thank all participants of the user study who were willing take their time and effort to test my work.
