\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{chapter:conclusions}

In this thesis, a context-aware recommender system that integrate contextual information into existing Active Learning recommender system using case-based recommendation approach was developed and evaluated.

Following the methodology developed for developing context-aware, relevance of contextual factors was first acquired using a web tool developed to ask users to rate the influence of purchasing decision while imagining themselves being in selected contextual conditions. After the relevance was obtained, a case-based recommendation approach was proposed to integrate contextual information into the recommender system by recommending clothes items bought by other users under similar contextual conditions to the current user. A case base was set up as a knowledge base for the recommendation. To solve the static suggestion ability problem of case base, collaborative filtering approach was used for long-term knowledge engineering. However, no privacy issue need to be worried about because the correlation between users is performed at the session level and no user identification is required. To compute the similarity between cases, the Euclidean Overlap Metric (HEOM) was borrowed. With the learned factor importance before, contextual explanation for each recommended item can be easily generated by finding out the most influential factors for the current type of recommended clothes.

A mobile Android application Shopper using the developed recommender system was developed and evaluated and was shown to have a better evaluation regarding prediction accuracy, decision effort and general satisfaction compared to the baseline system that is not context-aware. Also users were shown to be well aware of the benefits of contextual information and expressed a strong demand for context-aware recommendation in the evaluation. 

Several things can be done for future improvement. From the application design perspective, users can be allowed to control and specify values for as many context factors as possible. Right now, in the context setting view, values of part of the context factors such as weather or temperature are automatically detected if the users enabled them. However, during the evaluation, some users were complaining that the system was too intelligent by detecting the contextual information automatically and thus requirements for buying for future contextual scenarios can not be fulfilled. 

For the proposed recommendation approach, right now clothes items are recommended as individual items to the user. In the future recommendation of clothes set can be realized through extending the current case structure by including more than one clothes item in each case. For example, a user who bought a coat in cold temperature may also buy a scarf that can match with the coat. Then this scarf can be included in the same case with the coat and be recommended as a set to another user.

The recommendation quality can also be improved by extending the case model by including the evaluation model. Right now, a case is stored in the case base if the user bought an item and the bought item is automatically rated evaluated as ideal item for the corresponding context. In the future, more approaches can be adopted for the evaluation of the idealness of an item. The item viewed by the user, the item with positively critiqued by the user, the stores most often visited by the user can also be used as hints for evaluation. 

For the commercialization of the application, real data set instead of simulating one should be obtained from real offline stores, including the real time stock information for each clothes, the crowdedness of the store etc. However, this can be difficult because retailers are usually quite sensitive to the exposition of such data. This then comes to a business model problem. Furthermore, currently for evaluation purpose, the recommendation calculation is done on the mobile device and the database is also stored locally. In the future, they should all be migrated to a remote the server to reduce the burden of the client app and increase the system efficiency.
